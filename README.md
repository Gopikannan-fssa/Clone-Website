# Clone-Website

I've successfully made a website that looks like NVIDIA's using just HTML and CSS. This was a challenging but rewarding project that allowed me to show my web design skills.
The website closely resembles NVIDIA's official site, with their logo, a menu, and pictures of their products on the homepage. I also made pages with details about NVIDIA's products, including specifications, pictures, and videos.
I paid attention to the colors, fonts, and style to match NVIDIA's look.
I organized the content using HTML so it makes sense and is easy to find. 
This project shows that I can recreate complex website designs .
